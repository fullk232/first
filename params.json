{"name":"Final Project","tagline":"Final Project-UFOS","body":"##UFO Data & Info\r\nby Katie Fuller\r\n#Desciption\r\nFor this project I decided to visualize the current available info on UFOs provided by The National UFO Reporting Center Online Database. \r\n\r\n#link\r\n[Final Project!](http://b.parsons.edu/~fullk232/ufoinfo/)\r\n\r\n#Project Procedure\r\nThe data I found was really quantitatively huge. I decided to compile it by compressing the dates into decades instead of by individual day. I left out the sections that were unspecified. I then wanted a neat way to display this data so I chose to use ZingCharts. I found this library to be easy to customize and I like the way it looks because it's not too complicated. Ultimately I think the visualization looks as I would expect it to. The number of UFOs spotted has greatly increased. This is probably due to the influx of internet usage and people knowing where to report their sightings. I think the map visualization is very interesting. There isn't an obvious pattern as to where the most UFOs have been spotted. \r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
