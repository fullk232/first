  <h1>UFO Facts & Data</h1>
  <p>Below are two charts rendering the currently known UFO data. The data is compiled from<br> <a href="http://www.nuforc.org/webreports.html"> The National UFO Reporting Center Online Database</a> (NUFORC).<br>
  The NUFORC is an organization that collects data on extraterrestrial information. It is also a place where anyone can go to report a UFO sighting. This is how the data is collected. The site states that <i>obvious</i> hoaxes are not included in the data, but that some hoaxes might go unnoticed. That's why some of the data might not be perfectly accurate.</p><hr> <br>
  <div id='myChart'></div>
  <p>The chart above draws out the amount of UFOs spotted per decade from the 1900s to the 2010s. As you can see, the number has only increased and at this rate, will only continue to rise. The slight dip is likely due to the fact that we are only halfway through the 2010s.
  <hr><br>
  <div id='chartDiv2'></div>
  <p>This chart is demonstrating the number of UFOs spotted in each state. However, those spotted in Canada, internationally, or at an unspecified region are not represented here.<br>
  California is the state with the most sightings with 11,588 in total. The state with the least amount of sightings is North Dakota, with only 171.</p><hr>
