##UFO Data & Info
by Katie Fuller
#Desciption
For this project I decided to visualize the current available info on UFOs provided by The National UFO Reporting Center Online Database.

#Project Procedure
The data I found was really quantitatively huge. I decided to compile it by compressing the dates into decades instead of by individual day. I left out the sections that were unspecified. I then wanted a neat way to display this data so I chose to use ZingCharts. I found this library to be easy to customize and I like the way it looks because it's not too complicated. Ultimately I think the visualization looks as I would expect it to. The number of UFOs spotted has greatly increased. This is probably due to the influx of internet usage and people knowing where to report their sightings. I think the map visualization is very interesting. There isn't an obvious pattern as to where the most UFOs have been spotted.
